"Dear Wilhelm and Manjunath,
 
I really appreciate your work on truncated mv normal with the accompaning R code.
 
I referred your paper on "MOMENTS CALCULATION FOR THE DOUBLE TRUNCATED MULTIVARIATE NORMAL 
DENSITY" in my research work.

Would you please inform me (if published) the details of publication.
 

Best regards,
Fentaw Abegaz"

"I'm working on Bayesian regression models, 
subject to linear inequality constraints. 
My idea is to apply these models to index tracking problems, as an alternative to quadratic programming. 
The main advantage is that it allows for richer inference."

"Note that this request is in the context of probabilistic modelling of chemical intake from food. 
 In a Monte Carlo dietary risk assessment the exposure to chemicals from the diet is quantified as a distribution.  
 This is accomplished by combining data on food consumption with data on concentrations of chemicals in foods. 
 The chemical concentrations are often multivariate, i.e. more chemicals, with missing observations and observations 
 which are below a detection limit. 
 These chemical concentrations are modelled by means of a multivariate normal distribution, and parameters estimates 
 are needed for proper dietary risk assessment."

 "Many thanks for the code and the paper. I just ported the code to C# and it compares well with rejection sampling. 
  I am currently starting the Gibbs sampler at the maximum of the distribution, i.e. at the mean or, when the mean is outside the limits, close to the limits. I am currently using a Burnin of 1000 and Thinning of 10; I haven’t yet looked at the autocorrelation of the individual random variables. 
  Are these sensible values?
  
  With respect to the EM algorithm: when there are only missing values and no values below detection limits 
  (such values are called non-detects), the EM algorithm can be used because the conditional expectations of an individual missing xi and of a missing product xi*xj are known. Note that EM = ML in this case. However expectations for xi*xj are very cumbersome when there are non-detects, at least that is that we are currently thinking. 
  
  An alternative to EM is SEM which imputes missing values and non-detects by means of simulated values (not expectations) 
  from the conditional distributions. The imputed values are then used to estimate means and co(variances) and so on. 
  This works as follows: suppose that we have {X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6} with X1=x1,X2=x2 observed,X3,X4 missing and X5,X6 below their detection 
  limits. We first draw from the conditional distribution (X3,X4 | X1=x1,X2=x2) 
  which is a simple bivariate normal and then we draw from (X5,X6 | X1=x1,X2=x2,X3=x3,X4=x4) which is a bivariate truncated normal. 
  After a burnin, parameter estimates can be obtained by taking the mean of say the next 100 iterations. 

  An alternative would be to use a fully Bayesian approach with priors for the means and the variance-covariance matrix."
