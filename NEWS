changes in tmvtnorm  1.1-5 (2010-11-20)

# Added Maximum Likelihood estimation method (MLE) mle.tmvtnorm()
# optimized mtmvnorm(): precalcuted F_a[i] in a separate loop which improved the computation of the mean, suggested by Miklos.Reiter@sungard.com
# added a flag doComputeVariance (default TRUE), so users which are only interested in the mean, can compute
  only the variance (BTW: this flag does not make sense for the mean, since the mean has to be calculated anyway.)
# Fixed a bug with LAPACK and BLAS/FLIBS libraries:
Prof. Ripley/Writing R extensions: "For portability, the macros @code{BLAS_LIBS} and @code{FLIBS} should always be included @emph{after} @code{LAPACK_LIBS}."
  

changes in tmvtnorm 1.0-2 (2010-01-28)

# Added methods for the truncated multivariate t-Distribution : rtmvt(), dtmvt() und ptmvt()
  and ptmvt.marginal()

  
changes in tmvtnorm 0.9-2 (2010-01-03)

# Implementation of "thinning technique" for Gibbs sampling: Added parameter thinning=1 to rtmvnorm.gibbs() for thinning of Markov chains, 
  i.e. reducing autocorrelations of random samples
# Documenting additional arguments "thinning", "start.value" and "burn.in", for rmvtnorm.gibbs() 
# Added parameter "burn-in" and "thinning" in the Fortran code for discarding burn-in samples and thinng the Markov chain. 
# Added parameter log=FALSE to dtmvnorm.marginal()
# Added parameter margin=NULL to dtmvnorm() as an interface/wrapper to marginal density functions dtmvnorm.marginal() and dtmvnorm.marginal2()
# Code polishing and review
