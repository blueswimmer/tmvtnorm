Respected Sir,

I Manjunath B G, pursuing my research in Germany.

I need a clarification, the function rtmvnorm( ), which is used to generate random number from multivarite truncated normal density, here the method is rejection method.  There is no option to use Gibbs procedure generate random sample.  Because Gibbs sample procedure is more efficient than rejection sample.
